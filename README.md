# Utility Functions for JavaScript

This repository contains some useful utility functions for JavaScript.

> This repository is for all the lazy developers out there!

Have you come across a scenario where you had to spend a lot of time writing code for something which is super trivial and potentially not an important part of the application you are creating?

How about converting temperature from °C to °F? Or how about a adding commas at the appropriate places in a number like 123,000? Or even yet, how about simply generating a random number between 15000 and 25000?

This repositiory is for those sidekicks which make our coding life simpler!

<br />

### List of utility functions

-  Random Number Generator (between intervals)
-  Convert location decimal coordinates to degree coordinates.
-  Generate greeting of the day based on the time of the day.
-  Generate intials from a name.
-  Thousand separators for numbers.

<br />

### Motivation:
Across my four and half years of journey in web development, I realised that there is always a use-case where the developer needs a utility function to do a repetitive task.
<br />
For instance, as a part of the UI team at [Eugenie](https://www.eugenie.ai), we have always encountered a situation where we need to generate some random numbers for a quick demonstration to the client. Now, JavaScript, by default, provides a function called `Math.random()`, but what if I need my randomly generated values to be between, say, 12345 and 56789.

<br />

> A lot of time is spent by web developers in searching for such utility functions. I hope this repository proves to be the perfect medium for you to search for every utility function that might help you become a better developer.

<br />

This repository will be routinely updated with the latest utility functions. I will be actively maintaining a CHANGELOG to keep you abreast of all the different functions and modules that will be added.

### How to use?

In simple terms, you can simply copy paste the code shown in the JS files.

### I found a better code. Can I update this repo?

By all means, kindly do that. The sole purpose of creating this repo is to help fellow developers. Drop in a pull request and I will add it to the repo.
